# Introduction of the  **Test Images**

\#1,  A jet flow from our lab. The images, recoding the pulsed air jet with high-speed PCO camera,  have serious 'gridded' noise (may due to the image quantization). 

\#2, Turbulent Jet from PIV challenge.  First image pair from [Case A, 2003](http://www.pivchallenge.org/pub03/index.html#a)

\#3, Vortex Pair flow from  [PIV TEC  GmbH](http://www.pivtec.com/), 'Software / Sample image pairs'

\#4, Images to check spatial resolution in [PIV-Challenge 2005, case A4](http://www.pivchallenge.org/pub05/index.html#a) 

\#5, One pair of the [standard images for particle-image velocimetry](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-0233/11/6/311/meta;jsessionid=D021CE0C349B7BAFAFA70B9692312360.ip-10-40-1-105), and the official website [http://www.vsj.or.jp/piv](http://www.vsj.or.jp/piv) is not available.

\#6, An air flow case. Since I can not find the proper site link at present, you can tell me if have any idea.
